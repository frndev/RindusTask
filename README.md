## How to improve it
- Divide each method of Worker Protocol by use case in a single file to make a cleaner architecture.
- Implement unit tests and UI Tests, although the implemented architecture is prepared for that due to protocol implementation
- Create specific views for empty data from backend, an alert is show at the moment
- Receive photos response with pagination in order to not download innecessary data
- Persist data into app with Core Data, e.g.

### About security and authentication

- Create a way to authenticate users in order to not let them access in R/W mode to confidential data. This user could log in using its credentials.
- Having temporary session that expires if the user is not using the app in a while. When this event occurs, the user has to log in again.
- Hide data with a splashscreen when the user move the app to background
- If there were sensible user data, we could save it into keychain
- We are already using HTTPS protocol
